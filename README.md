## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Pytorch 1.4.0+
* PyTorch Geometric (see https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric for detail)
* Transformers

## Dataset

We provide three processed datasets: NYT-520K, NYT-570K and GDS. Download the datasets and pretrained word embeddings from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ROz5GkSEl5Ka9a1uuftPqcdpM6aFhGy/view?usp=sharing), and extract them under `data` folder.

## Training & Evaluation

Vanilla CGRE consists of PCNN and GCN, but we also provide some different backbone models: `CNN`, `PCNN` and `Bert` for sentence encoding and `GCN`, `GAT` and `SAGE` for graph encoding. 

For example, you can try CNN+GAT on NYT-520K by the following command:

    python train.py --config 520K_CNN_GAT.yaml
and

    python eval.py --config 520K_CNN_GAT.yaml

Please see configuration files in `config/` for more choices.

## Results

PR curves in our paper are stored in `Curves/`.
